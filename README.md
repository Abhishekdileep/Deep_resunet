# Deep_resunet
Deep Residual U-Net (ResUNet) is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) 
architecture for image segmentation tasks. It combines the U-Net architecture, 
which is widely used in medical imaging, with residual connections, 
which can help the model learn deeper and more accurate representations of the input data
* model.py contains the architecture
